# PKVWebsite
Pranav Knowledge Village is first website I made to learn if else condition and combined with the HTML knowledge

> Pardon me if the graphics looks old but this was made by me in Microsoft App, I don't remeber exctely now. But it was in 2013 when I coded this website in my schools computer in computer classes. There are many things written in this website which might be looking childish, Because it was made by a child who used this thing called computer for 3-4 months in intervals. I wanted to preseve this memory as it is so nothing is changed.

> It is often seems very minor change, untill all accumulates and changes flow of rivers!!!
